# slack-logs-parser
To get a list of countries, you just need to place the `access_logs.csv` file from Slack next to `main.go` and run the program with the `-date` flag (in DD-MM-YYYY format) which works as "date from". You can also specify a different file location (and/or name) using the `-file` flag.
